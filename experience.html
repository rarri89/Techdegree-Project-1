        <h2>Work History</h2>
        <p>While in college, I worked as a per diem unit secretary at a hospital near my hometown.</p>
        <p>After graduating, I worked for a contract manufacturing organization helping with the production of topical medications for about a year until I started my first customer service job at a lighting fixture vendor.</p>
        <p>Learning a lot about customer service, I transitioned to the same role for a contract research organization. Here, I fine-tuned my skills and progressed into sales and account management.</p>
        <p>Progressing further, I landed a new role in sales for a healthcare marketing company. In this company, I was exposed to web development and digital marketing and the seed for my interest in computer languages was planted.</p>
